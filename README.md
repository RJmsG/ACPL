ACPL is a new lanugae I've been working on.
It's a compiled language that is designed to be fast but also easy to use.

### What does "ACPL" stand for?
ACPL, Ironically, stands for Axe's Complicated Programming Language.
I was gonna call it ASPL, but the name stuck.

## More information
ACPL's latest (language) version is A23, it is mainained by Me(RJmsG), and ShowierData9978.

### A23 is currently being developed!
It will have alot of exciting changes, including:

1) Native support for **Dynamic Arrays**
2) Better variable refrencing

#### I am currently looking for other's help to make ACPL better
If you can, join the project and spread the word!
