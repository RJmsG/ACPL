# ACPL

ACPL is a new lanugae I've been working on.
It's a compiled language that is designed to be fast but also easy to use.

### What does "ACPL" stand for?
ACPL, Ironically, stands for Axe's Complicated Programming Language.
I was gonna call it ASPL, but the name stuck.

## More information
The ACPL compiler's latest version is 1.3, and it is developed by Me(RJmsG) and ShowierData9978.
The current version of the language itself is A23

### Whats new in A23 & the compiler?
Quite a bit of changes:

1) Fixed an error involving no newline at the end of files.
2) Added new Dynamic Arrays and FAV(Flexible Address Variables)!
3) Rewritten and removed some unnecesary compiler code involving output.
4) Added ability to import other ACPL and C files.
5) Added new form of data storage.

### Goals for ACPL:

1) Full port to the C language
2) Switch to llvm
3) Native support for C and Python

A goal has finally been reached! (support for dynamic arrays)

#### I am currently looking for other's help to make ACPL better
If you can, join the project and spread the word!
