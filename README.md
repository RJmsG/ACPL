# ACPL
## This is the official repository for a new W.I.P. programming language I've been working on.
I'm currently looking for some feedback on how people feel about different aspects of the language.
Also, I'm looking for some people that might join this project so I can get some better feedback and help from them.

## What makes this language great?
ACPL is designed to be a fast, but also easy-to-understand programming language.
It also introduces some features that make things much more easily accessible and efficient.

### What are its cool features?
ACPL promisies great features such as:
* native support for fam(s) and dynamic arrays
* nested function declaration
* native support for type casting
* replacement for agruments with variable data

You could call it the ScratchCE of text-based programming languages!
