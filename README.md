# ACPL

ACPL is a new lanugae I've been working on.
It's a compiled language that is designed to be fast but also easy to use.

### What does "ACPL" stand for?
ACPL, Ironically, stands for Axe's Complicated Programming Language.
I was gonna call it ASPL, but the name stuck.

## More information
ACPL's latest version is 1.2, it is mainained by Me(RJmsG).

### Whats new in 1.2?
A few small changes have been added:

1) Embedded GCC
2) Default option to download the generated C code

### Goals for ACPL:

1) support for dynamic arrays
2) full port to the C language
3) switch to llvm
4) Support for C & Python based libraries

#### I am currently looking for other's help to make ACPL better
If you can, join the project and spread the word!
